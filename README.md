### Decision_Tree
Build decision stumps and a decision tree to diagnose whether a patient has some disease based on their symptoms and medical test results.  

Include:
1. Pruning.
2. Output the test results.
3. Generate the tree of such the format in the writeup: 'if (x3 <= 6) return 2 .......'

* ToDo:
* Directly output the test results using the modeled tree.
